# iosAppNat — native iOS app

A SwiftUI version of the Writeopia iOS app. The existing `iosApp` hosts the Compose Multiplatform UI; this one is fully native and talks to the Writeopia API gateway (`https://writeopia.io`) directly.

Requirements: Xcode 26+ (Swift 6.2 toolchain). Deployment target iOS 17. No third-party dependencies.

## Flow

`AppSession.phase` drives `RootView`:

- `spaceChoice`: pick the **private space** (offline, documents stored as `.wrdoc.json`/`.wrfolder.json` in Application Support) or the **open space** (online).
- `signedOut`: login, with register and password recovery.
- `emailConfirmation`: shown after registering, or when logging in with an unconfirmed email.
- `chooseWorkspace`: list or create team workspaces.
- `ready`: tabs for Documents, Search and Settings.

From Settings > Account, the private space offers **Sign in** and **Switch space**. The open space offers Change workspace, Switch space, Change password, Sign out and Delete account.

## Running

Open `iosAppNat.xcodeproj` and run the `iosAppNat` scheme. To point the app at another gateway, set the `WRITEOPIA_BASE_URL` environment variable in the scheme.

## Documents list

- Slide a card sideways to select it, like the Compose notes list (`SwipeBox`); several can be selected. The selection menu mirrors `NotesSelectionMenu`: **Copy** (documents with new ids; folders with what's inside), **Favorite** (or remove from favorites when all are), **AI Summary** (open space: the selected documents as Markdown are sent to `/api/ai/summary` and the answer becomes a new document in the folder; the Compose app uses local AI for this), **Delete** (after confirmation; folders with their contents; synced like single deletions) and an "N selected ✕" chip.

## Editor

Documents open in an editable editor. Supported step types: `TITLE`, `TEXT`, `CODE_BLOCK`, `IMAGE`, `CHECK_ITEM`, `UNORDERED_LIST_ITEM`, `DIVIDER`, `DOCUMENT_LINK`, `AI_ANSWER`, `LOADING`, `SPACE` and `ON_DRAG_SPACE`. Other types (spreadsheets, videos...) are kept in the document but not drawn.

- Text is edited in place. Return splits a step (the title continues as a paragraph, lists and checklists continue as items, Return on an empty item leaves the list). Backspace at the start merges into the previous line, turns a list item into a paragraph, or removes a divider/link above.
- Existing spans (bold, italic, underline, highlights, links) are drawn and follow the text as it's edited. Bold, italic, underline, highlights (yellow, green, red) and links can be applied to the selected text from the menu. Comments aren't supported.
- Hold the grip on the left of a step and drop it on another step or space to reorder.
- Slide a line sideways to select it (slide again to unselect), like the SDK's `SwipeBox`. Several lines can be selected. While lines are selected, the bottom menu becomes the selection menu of the SDK's `EditionScreen`: AI on the selected lines, bold/italic/underline, checkbox, list item, code block, Box/Card, Title/SubTitle/Header, link to a new page, copy (plain and rich text), cut, delete, and an "N selected ✕" chip that shows the count and clears the selection.
- A bottom menu mirrors the Compose editor (AI, bold, italic, underline, highlight, link, drawing, image, undo, redo). Everything works except undo and redo, which are placeholders.
- AI (open space only) opens a dialog to apply a command to the document or the line with the cursor: Prompt, Summary, Action Points, FAQ and Tags. The answer streams from `/api/ai/*` (Server-Sent Events) into an `AI_ANSWER` step, with a `LOADING` step until it starts.
- **Image** opens the photo picker. The image is saved on the device as a JPEG (at most 2048 px) and added where the cursor is, like the SDK's `addImage`: after the title, in place of an empty line, or after the current line (at the end with no cursor). In the open space it's uploaded to `/api/media/upload` and the step switches from the local `path` to the returned `url`; if the upload fails it stays local. Long press an image to delete it.
- **Drawing** opens a full screen canvas (pen, highlighter, eraser, 11 colors, 5 widths, undo, clear) like the Compose drawing feature. Saving adds a `DRAWING` step (type 100) at the end of the document with the strokes as JSON in its text, in the same format as Android. In the document the drawing is cropped to its strokes; tap it to edit, long press to delete.
- The top right menu mirrors `NoteGlobalActionsMenu` of the Compose app:
  - **Lock document**: read-only mode (text, checkboxes, dragging, selection and the bottom menu are disabled); a lock shows next to the title.
  - **Font**: System, Serif, Monospace or Cursive, remembered for every document.
  - **Export as Json / Markdown**: writes `{"data": <document>}` or the SDK's Markdown to a file and opens the share sheet.
  - **Publish to Web**: for premium users in the open space, publish/unpublish (`/document/{id}/publish`, `/unpublish`, `/published`) and copy the `https://app.writeopia.io/site/<id>` link. Others see the "Premium Feature" dialog, as in the Compose app. The backend doesn't send the user tier yet, so everyone currently counts as free.

## Persistence and sync

Mirrors the Compose app (`DocumentLoadUseCase`, `DocumentMerger`, `FolderSync`, the conflict handlers and `OnUpdateStoryStepSyncTracker`).

- **Storage**: a SQLite database per space, with a schema that mirrors the Compose app (`document`, `story_step`, `folder`). The private space lives in `Application Support/Writeopia/PrivateSpace/writeopia.sqlite`; each workspace of the open space has a local cache in `Application Support/Writeopia/Workspaces/<id>/writeopia.sqlite`. Each step is a row (its content as JSON), so an edit writes only the steps that changed. Documents keep `lastUpdatedAt` / `lastSyncedAt`, and steps their own `lastUpdatedAt`. JSON files from earlier versions are imported once and moved to `imported-json/`.
- **Opening a folder** shows the cache right away, then syncs it: `POST /api/docs/workspace/document/folder/diff`, conflicts settled like the Compose app (the copy updated last wins, documents deleted on this device aren't brought back), local changes sent with `POST /api/docs/workspace/document` and `/folder`, and the result shown. Synced items the backend no longer has in the folder are removed (deleted or moved on another device). Pull to refresh syncs again.
- **Opening a document** shows the local copy, then merges the backend copy (`GET .../document/{id}`): steps matched by id, the newest wins, steps from both sides kept. The merge replaces what's shown only if nothing was typed yet.
- **Editing** saves on the device on every change (only the changed steps, like the Compose app's `OnUpdateDocumentTracker`), and sends the changed and deleted steps with `POST .../document/{id}/steps/sync` after 2 s without typing, and when leaving the editor. When a push fails, the document stays outdated and the next folder sync sends it whole.
- New documents and folders are created locally with their final id and sent right away when possible.
- **Deleting** a document (editor menu > Delete document) removes it for good in the private space. In the open space it's marked deleted locally (so no sync brings it back), deleted on the backend with `POST .../document/delete`, then removed; when the backend can't be reached, the deletion is sent first thing in the next sync of its folder.

Differences with the Compose app: steps are stamped with their own `lastUpdatedAt` (so merges pick the newest copy of each step instead of always the local one), and a successful `steps/sync` marks the document as synced.

## Translations

The app is in English and Portuguese (`pt`). All the strings are in one String Catalog, `iosAppNat/Localizable.xcstrings`; code in the packages looks them up in the app bundle too.

- In views, literals are translated automatically (`Text("Settings")`, `Button("Save")`, and the `WrDesign` components, which take `LocalizedStringKey`). Text built outside views uses `String(localized:)` (errors, enum titles, the welcome document).
- Counts use plural variations (`"%lld items"` → "1 item" / "3 itens").
- To find new strings, build with `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS=YES`: the compiler writes a `.stringsdata` file per source file (packages included, they set `defaultLocalization: "en"`) with every key and its format specifiers. Add the missing keys and their Portuguese to the catalog.
- To see the app in Portuguese: `xcrun simctl launch <device> io.writeopia.WriteopiaNative -AppleLanguages "(pt)"`, or pick Portuguese in the scheme's App Language.

## Tests

```bash
# Core (runs on macOS)
cd Packages/Core && swift test

# Editor and Features (iOS only)

# UI smoke tests (they expect a fresh private space: uninstall the app from the simulator first)
xcodebuild test -project iosAppNat.xcodeproj -scheme iosAppNat -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'
